GENERAL INFORMATION:
* Task Name: todomvc web application test automation task
* First Name, Last Name: Serkan Kenc (skenc06@gmail.com)
* Software QA Testing Coding Challenge (UI Part)
* Language: Java
* Installation Guide:
This is a Maven project that host runs this code Java and Maven is already installed and JAVA_HOME already set.
All dependencies in my pom.xml file come from Maven repository which means additional installation is needed.
* Dependencies:
 -Junit
 -Bonigarcia WebDriver
 -Selenium
 -Cucumber
* Plugins: maven-surfire-plugin, CukesRunner, maven-cucumber-reporting
* Framework can be created by using TestNG or Cucumber BDD, I preferred Cucumber BDD.
* The project is built by using Page Object Model(POM) desing pattern but it can improve if case of need. So that locators/methods are in the central location (ToDoPage)
* For reporting I used Maven Plugin in pom.xml file. I have Cucumber and Default HTML reporting with browser
* Gherkin language is used.
